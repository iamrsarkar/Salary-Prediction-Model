# Overview

This file contains the implementation of a Salary Prediction Model that estimates salaries based on input features like Years of Experience. The model uses a regression algorithm to analyze the relationship between features and the target variable (salary).

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, scaling, and cleaning the dataset.
Model Selection: Focuses on linear regression and compares performance with other regression techniques.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score, and MAE for accuracy assessment.
Visualization: Plots regression lines and data points for clear insights into the relationship between variables.
